Current progress: 
- Our algorithms return chromatic numbers for 9/20 (1,6,8,10,11,12,16,17,19), upper bounds for 20/20, and lower bounds for 18/20 (except 05 and 08) Steven's graphs. But it takes more than 2 mins for some graphs.

1st week plan:
- Manh: implements 2 more heuristic (upper bound) algorithms: RLF and Tabu search (or Genetic Algorithm if Tabu search is not feasible)
- Simon: implements 1 more exact algorithm: Brown's modified algorithm aka Branch and bound, books the room for Wednesday.
- Mathias: continues working on the maximal independence set aka the best exact algorithm known so far!
- Stan: discovers more families of graphs that can be solved in polynomial time. Starts with: perfect graph, chordal graph (a subclass of perfect graph). For each class, implements 2 things: test if the input graph belongs to this class and if so how to compute its the chromatic number.
- Paula: studies the graph connectivity, implements an algorithm that divides the input graph into connected components.
- Working together on Wednesday.

2nd week plan:
- Build a ML classifier (if necessary) for algorithm selection.
