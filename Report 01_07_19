1st week plan:
- Manh: implements 2 more heuristic (upper bound) algorithms: RLF and Tabu search (or Genetic Algorithm if Tabu search is not feasible)
- Simon: implements 1 more exact algorithm: Brown's modified algorithm aka Branch and bound
- Mathias: continues working on the maximal independence set aka the best exact algorithm known so far!
- Stan: discovers more families of graphs that can be solved in polynomial time. Starts with: perfect graph, chordal graph (a subclass of perfect graph). For each class, implements 2 things: test if the input graph belongs to this class and if so how to compute its the chromatic number.
- Paula: studies the graph connectivity, implements an algorithm that divides the input graph into connected components.

2nd week plan:
- Build a ML classifier (if necessary) for algorithm selection.
